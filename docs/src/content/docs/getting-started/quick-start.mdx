<Aside type="caution" title="Pre-release notice">
Neova is currently in pre-release and not yet code-signed for macOS. After installing, run this command in Terminal to allow the app to open:

```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Neova.app
```

## Open Your Project Folder

Launch Neova and open your project folder — the same folder your coding agent works in.

Neova creates a `.neova/` folder inside your project. Everything stays local:

- **Your data stays on your machine** — no cloud, no sync, no external services
- **Agents can access it** — because it lives in the same folder they already work in
- **Full version control** — commit your tasks and templates alongside your code

## Configure Your Stages

Stages define the steps your tasks move through. Think of them as columns on a kanban board.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Stages**
2. Add, remove, or reorder stages to match your workflow

A typical setup might look like:

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Backlog | Ideas and upcoming work |
| Prepare | Research, design, specifications |
| Implement | Active development |
| Verify | Testing and review |
| Done | Completed work |

## Create Activities

Activities are structured prompt templates. You configure them once and reuse them every time you work on a task.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Activities**
2. Create a new activity or import an existing template

Each activity contains a prompt template with placeholders that get filled in automatically when you use it.

## Assign Activities to Stages

Once you've created activities, assign them to stages. When a task is in a stage, the assigned activities appear as buttons on that task.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Stages**
2. Select a stage
3. Choose which activities should be available in that stage

![Neova Assigning an Activity to a Stage](/assets/img/neova-assign-activity-to-stage.png)

Activities can be assigned to multiple stages. For example:
- **Debug** → Prepare, Verify
- **Implement** → Implement
- **Test & Review** → Verify

## Create Your First Task

1. Click **+ New Task** on your board
2. Give it a title and optional description
3. The task appears in your default stage

Use the stage buttons to move it through your workflow.

## Run an Activity

With a task selected:

1. Open the task or right-click it
2. Choose an activity from the available options for that stage
3. The activity template renders with your task context filled in

## Copy & Use Your Prompt

Once an activity is rendered:

1. **Right-click the task** and select **Copy Prompt**, or
2. **Open the task** and click the copy button

Paste the prompt directly into your coding agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other tool.

Your agent now has structured context: what to do, how to approach it, and where the task fits in your workflow.
